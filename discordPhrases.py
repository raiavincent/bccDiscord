kramnik1 = "I'd like to thank chess.com for organizing these tournaments and giving me a chance to participate. However, I’ve decided to play only twice; yesterday was my first and last time. I was unpleasantly surprised by the general attitude of flagging opponents in dead draw or lost positions. While the rules (no increment) permit it, I believe moral values, such as respect for chess, the opponent, and dignity, should take precedence. Ironically, one opponent who cynically flagged me had a nickname including 'Fairplay'. To avoid misunderstanding, I enjoyed playing chess after a long break and couldn’t participate in Sunday’s final due to travel. Yet, I feel uneasy realizing how much the chess world has changed. What was once shameful and unsportsmanlike behavior is now becoming the norm. This relaxed attitude could lead to cheating becoming morally accepted over time. As a strong grandmaster, I find flagging in rapid chess generally unacceptable, especially against a veteran who is twice your age and a former world champion. I understand the new generation may have different moral and cultural standards, but I will adhere to mine and avoid participating in what I consider a moral and cultural degradation show. These no-increment tournaments on chess.com demonstrate, to my regret, that the only way to maintain chess as a gentleman's game is to enforce gentlemanly behavior by adding increments and implementing strict anti-cheating measures. Personally, I prefer to play incognito friendly matches with players who share similar values if I feel like playing chess."
